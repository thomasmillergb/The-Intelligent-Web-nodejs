The-Intelligent-Web-nodejs


This is a final year project using node js to create a reactive base website which would use websoctes to send data back from the backend to the reactive frontend

This project was able to query/stream data from 4 sqaure and twitter, present the finding on the website and store the data in the database for future use.

This type of project could quite easily be turned into a stalking app which allows the user to follow a twitter account and see
where every tweet was comign from.
